    "The Rietholzbach catchment (3.3 km<sup>2</sup> ) is part of the Thur river basin, located in Northeast-Switzerland (Melsen2014). The altitude ranges from 950 to 682 m, with an average slope of 14.5 $^\\circ$. Land use consists of 72\\% pastures, 26\\% forest, 1\\% orchards and 1\\% settlements. Soil depth (on bedrock of limestone, dolomite, and conglomerate) varies from 20-50 cm on steep slopes, to several meters in the valley. The simple dynamical system approach has already been applied to the Rietholzbach catchment (Teuling et al.,\n",
